General list of things todo
---------------------------

* git grep 'TODO' and fix
* include what you use: lots of headers rely on ambient includes
* add more tests and have a run-under-valgrind target at least
* add a test for each public header file being "self-contained"
* move more things over to the Request/Response way of doing things

Further out things
------------------
* Generalise the request/response so that persistent connections can be phrased
  as them.
* Benchmark and add benchmarks to the tests.
